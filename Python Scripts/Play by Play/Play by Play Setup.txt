Alright, so you want Dottie's bot, and you have no clue how to make it work

You probably just downloaded python, and the code, and it does nothing.

good job, you've completed part 1.




Step 1: Download python, latest version is fine.

Step 2: Download Dotties code, you can either download the .py file, or just copy paste into IDLE and save as a .py file

Step 3: Go into the path you downloaded python to, default path is C:\Users\(YOU)\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python(version), keep that open

Step 4: Open command line

Step 5: type in CD C:\Users\(YOU)\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python(version)\Scripts

Step 6: run the following commands, one by one

pip3 install praw
pip3 install dhooks
pip3 install datetime


Step 7: Close command line and pat yourself on the back for doing a good job

Step 8: open the python file, and fill it in, Dottie wrote some good instructions in the comments

Step 8.5: Respect the fact that Dottie actually commented the code

Step 9: Once it's all filled in, close the editor

Step 10: Place the program in your python folder, the same one thats C:\Users\(YOU)\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python(version)

Step 11: Run the program

Step 12: If the program opens a black box and sits there, good job, its running.
